        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing an MBA at Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Management as a Dean's Scholar, focusing on Finance, Operations, and Analytics. Additionally, I work with the MBA Recruitment team as a Recruitment Experience Ambassador and as a Teaching Assistant for courses such as Managerial Statistics, Managerial Accounting, and Corporate Valuation.</p>
        <p>My journey toward becoming a finance and operations executive has been shaped by diverse experiences, including working in Investment Banking in South Carolina and serving as a Senior Associate on the Deals Strategy and Operations team at PwC in India and Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>I am deeply committed to learning, embracing new experiences, and expanding my network. During my undergraduate years, I balanced roles as a Salesperson, a bookstore owner, and a research associate, consistently ranking at the top of my class. After graduation, I embarked on an exchange semester in Finland, supported by an Erasmus scholarship.</p>
