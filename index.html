        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing an MBA at Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Management as a Dean's Scholar. My primary areas of focus are Finance, Operations, and Analytics. Additionally, I work with the MBA Recruitment team as a Recruitment Experience Ambassador and with my professors as the Teaching Assistant for courses such as Managerial Statistics, Managerial Accounting, and Corporate Valuation.</p>
        <p>My journey toward becoming a finance and operations executive has been shaped by diverse experiences. I worked in Investment Banking in South Carolina during the summer and previously served as a Senior Associate on the Deals Strategy and Operations team at PwC India and Bangladesh. In this role, I provided market research, commercial due diligence, and comprehensive strategy consulting services to clients across South Asia, Asia-Pacific, the US, and the UK.</p>
        <p>I'm deeply committed to learning, embracing new experiences, and expanding my network. During my undergraduate years, I balanced roles as a Salesperson, a bookstore owner, and a research associate while consistently ranking at the top of my class. After graduation, instead of immediately pursuing a high-paying job, I embarked on an exchange semester in Finland, supported by an Erasmus scholarship. During this time, I collaborated with individuals from 17 countries and gained valuable insights into service design.</p>
        <p>Upon returning from Finland, I had two job offersâ€”one from a commercial bank and another from PwC. Despite the latter offering a 40% lower salary, I chose PwC to gain diverse experiences as a consultant, develop versatile skills, and emerge as a leader. I became the first member of the Deals Strategy team at PwC Bangladesh, directly supervised by PwC India. It was an honor to assist over 20 clients with 27 new and repeat projects, guiding them in pursuing M&A and investment opportunities in Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Driven by my relentless pursuit of growth and learning, along with my aspiration to become a business leader, I decided to come to the United States. I feel incredibly privileged and fortunate to have the opportunity to pursue my MBA at Vanderbilt with a 100% tuition scholarship.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my profile, and I warmly invite you to connect with me and start a meaningful conversation!</p>
